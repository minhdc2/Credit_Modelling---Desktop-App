# Credit_Modelling---Desktop-App

## 1. Introduction ##
This app illustrates multivariate-analysis steps in **PD (Probability Default) model**, which includes:

* Step 1: Technically adjust original WoE of special bins based on defined rules
* Step 2: Update revised WoE values for all features in both train and test dataset
* Step 3: Remove highly correlated features on given threshold
* Step 4: Backward features elimination
* Step 5: Run scenarios combinations
* Step 6: Bootstrapping validation

## 2. How to use ##
### 2.1 GUI ###
* GUI framework: Tkinter <br/>
To navigate to specific steps, you can select options in menu **Steps** or click on buttons displayed.

>*(!) Option **Single Factor Analysis** has not been developed yet!*
